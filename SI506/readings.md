And what is it to be human and alive and exercise your humanity in that kind of exchange?

1. Introduction
One of the first winners, in 1994, was Wired columnist Charles Platt. How would he do it? By “being moody, irritable, and obnoxious,”易怒的 he says—which strikes me as not only hilarious and bleak but also, in some deeper sense, a call to arms战斗的号令: How, in fact, do we be the most human humans we can be—not only under the constraints of the test, but in life?

But in any event,无论如何 the central question of how computers are reshaping our sense of self, and what the ramifications of that process will be, is clearly the crucial one.

After briefing me a bit on the logistics of the competition, he gave me the advice I had heard from confederates past to expect: “There’s not much more you need to know, really. You are human, so just be yourself.”

We go through digital life, in the twenty-first century, with our guards up.
An odd twist: we’re like the thing that used to be like us. We imitate our old imitators, one of the strange reversals of fortune in the long saga of human uniqueness.
Debunk 揭穿
Oxford philosopher John Lucas says, for instance, that if we fail to prevent the machines from passing the Turing test, it will be“not because machines are so intelligent, but because humans, many of them at least, are so wooden.” 呆板的

Part of what’s fascinating about studying the programs that have done well at the Turing test is that it is a (frankly, sobering) study of how conversation can work in the total absence of emotional intimacy.

But I prefer, for a number of reasons, the notion of rivals—who only ostensibly want to win, and who know that competition’s main purpose is to raise the level of the game. All rivals are symbiote. They need each other. They keep each other honest. They make each other better. The story of the progression of technology doesn’t have to be a dehumanizing or dispiriting one. Quite, as you will see, the contrary.
